# dex2dot

This is my tool. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My tool is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my tool is useless. Without my tool, I am useless.

## Seriously, though

This script will build a .dot file of a single dalvik function. The result will be a graph of basic blocks, that should be easier to read than just the plain bytecode.

## Dependencies

You must have dexdump (from the Android SDK) on your $PATH.

Only tested on Linux.

## What do I do with the .dot output?

Look at it with a dot file viewer. I use xdot.
